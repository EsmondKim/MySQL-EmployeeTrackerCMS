## Description
This app uses a MySQL database to track employees of an organization. Users can view all the organization's employees, or view employees by department, or by manager. Users can change an employee's role, update the employee's manger, add employees, or delete employees. Behind the scenes several MySql tables are being updated and joined in a variety of ways using id's and foreign keys.
